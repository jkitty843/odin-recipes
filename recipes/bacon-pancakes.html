  <div class="ingredient">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10 strips of Bacon, fried until crispy</li>
      <li>1 cup (120g) Flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Pinch of Baking Soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter, melted, plus extra for frying</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (180g) Buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
      <li>Maple Syrup, to serve</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter and buttermilk, then whisk in the egg.</li>
      <li>Tip the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture and whisk together until it is lump-free. 
        Prepare a large skillet by melting some butter to prevent the batter from sticking, then add as many bacon strips as you can put in the skillet with enough distance
        between each one to add the pancake batter. You will probably have to do this in batches.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the pancake batter down the length of each bacon strip until it is covered. Make sure the batter around one bacon strip does not touch the batter
         covering a neighboring strip of baconâ€”you want them to be individual pancakes and rectangular-ish.
      </li>
      <li>Cook until the pancake batter starts to bubble on the surface, then flip them over and brown the other side. Repeat until there are no more slices of bacon. Drizzle with maple syrup and serve. Defiance.</li>
