    <h2>Description:</h2>

      Zelda fans will be familiar with the tall, vibrant, googly-eyed Chuchu vacantly wandering Hyrule's varied environments, as well as the useful potions made from their colorful <strong>Chu Jelly</strong>.
      This simple yet creative gelatin recipe pleases both the eye and your sweet tooth.

  <div class="ingredient">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups Fruit Juice (I used Passionfruit but any juice will do, Apple will make it more transparent)</li>
      <li>1 cup Tonic Water (regular water can substituted if you don't want the bitterness, but tonic water will make the jelly <em>glow in a black light!)</em></li>
      <li>Food Dyes (Colors based on preference)</li>
      <li>4 packets Gelatin</li>
      <li>Honey or other sweetener (Optional)</li>
      <li>A Glass Pitcher or Funnel</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make sure you have all your ingredients ready and accessible, because we are working with hot liquid and time-senstive gelatin.</strong></li>
      <li>Bring your juice and tonic water to a boil. If you are adding sweetener to the mix to mask the tonic taste, add it as it boils.</li>
      <li>After the liquid has reached a boil, <em>SLOWLY</em> stir in the gelatin with a wooden spoon, careful not to add too much at once or it may clump.</li>
      <li>Pour the liquid into the pitcher. Add the liquid from the pitcher to your bottles. If you are using a funnel, funnel the liquid directly into your bottles.</li>
      <li>Add a few drops of the food coloring you want for that particular bottle into the liquid, and stir until the color is consistent throughout the bottle.</li>
      <li>Once the bottles look right, refrigerate them for about two hours or until the jelly has become a more jelly-like texture.</li>
    </ol>
