    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><i>Dark Souls</i> is a video game both famous and infamous for unapologetically difficult combat and a sprawling interconnected world, 
      all of which is cohesively designed to make the world of Lordran feel as isolating and unwelcoming to the player as it is to their character.
      Set in a cold and fading world where players fight through mindless undead, imposing knights, and grotesque demons, the most comfort one can find is in the game's reliable health-restoring <strong>Estus Flask.</strong>
      Here's one recipe that imagines the warm incandescent orange draught as <strong>a strong drink that burns fiery with citrus notes</strong> which will certainly remind you to Praise the Sun on the way down.
