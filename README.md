# odin-recipes
Recipe website for The Odin Project curriculum

This website is a basic project in HTML to practice and demonstrate the ability to create an organized and functional (though barebones) recipe website. The site is comprised of a simple homepage and pages for a few recipes. There is no implementation of CSS, though it will likely be revisted in the future.
